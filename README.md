This project is work in progress and may change significantly in the next time. We do not recommend using it in productive applications, yet. Nevertheless you are invited to try it out and give us feedback.

## Overview

The Griffin+ *Dynamic Code Generation* library is set of classes that assist with creating and implementing types at runtime. It is the base to build powerful features that require code referring to types that are not known at compile time. This library takes over the implementation of repetitive tasks that differ only marginally from each other and thus reduces the error probability compared to error-prone manual implementations.

## Supported Platforms

The library is entirely written in C# using .NET Standard 2.0.

Therefore it should work on the following platforms (or higher):
- .NET Framework 4.6.1
- .NET Core 2.0
- .NET 5.0
- Mono 5.4
- Xamarin iOS 10.14
- Xamarin Mac 3.8
- Xamarin Android 8.0
- Universal Windows Platform (UWP) 10.0.16299

The library is tested automatically on the following frameworks and operating systems:
- .NET Framework 4.6.1 (Windows Server 2019)
- .NET Core 3.1 (Windows Server 2019 and Ubuntu 20.04)
- .NET 5.0 (Windows Server 2019 and Ubuntu 20.04)

## Usage
